Simulating the timing of the solar noon throughout the year

Unlike the length of days that changes in a regular fashion throughout the year, i.e. a simple sinusoidal form with the maxima and minima at summer and winter solstices respectively, the position of the solar noon has a rather complex behavior. The goal of the current study is to simulate this behavior as a function of the planetary orbital shape and eccentricity.
